*** Quick start

To test our project from the start, you can run blocks of code, one by one.

To test any counterpart of our project, you should always run the Map_and_Block library first.

We recommend you to try using Google Colab, as it has a table of contents where we break our codes into parts, and also description of each part.
If so, please import all the files with the form 'inpx.txt' and 'inpx_2.txt' from 'testcases' folder 
and you can see some visualization by importing all PNG files from 'testcases' and 'heuristic' folder.

And if you read this, we hope you have a nice day!
